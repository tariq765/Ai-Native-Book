# LLM-Based Planning for Humanoid Robots

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for robot task planning
- Learn to integrate LLMs with humanoid robot control systems
- Implement AI-driven planning for complex humanoid tasks

## Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-level reasoning and planning in robotics. For humanoid robots, LLMs can interpret complex human instructions and generate detailed action plans that account for the robot's physical capabilities and environmental constraints.

## Why LLM-Based Planning Matters in Physical AI
LLMs provide humanoid robots with the ability to understand natural language commands and decompose them into executable actions. This capability allows robots to perform complex, multi-step tasks that require understanding of context, common sense reasoning, and adaptation to novel situations.

## LLM Integration Architecture
The integration of LLMs with humanoid robots typically involves:
- Natural language understanding
- Task decomposition
- Action planning
- Execution monitoring
- Feedback integration

## Connecting to Humanoid Robots
LLM planning for humanoid robots must consider:
- Physical constraints and kinematics
- Environmental affordances
- Safety requirements
- Social context and norms
- Multi-modal perception inputs

## Future Industry Relevance
As humanoid robots enter workplaces and homes, LLM-based planning will enable them to follow natural instructions and adapt to changing requirements without explicit programming for every scenario.

## Key Takeaways
- LLMs provide flexible, natural interfaces for humanoid robot control
- Proper integration requires careful consideration of physical constraints
- Safety and reliability remain paramount in LLM-guided systems
