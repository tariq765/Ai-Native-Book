# Capstone: Integrating VLA for Humanoid Robotics

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate Vision, Language, and Action systems on a humanoid robot
- Implement a complete AI-driven humanoid application
- Evaluate the performance of integrated VLA systems

## Introduction
The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) capstone project combines all components learned in this module to create an intelligent humanoid robot capable of perceiving its environment, understanding natural language commands, and executing complex physical tasks.

## Project Overview
In this capstone project, students will develop a complete system that:
- Processes visual input from the robot's cameras
- Understands natural language commands
- Plans and executes physical actions
- Adapts to changing environments and requirements

## Integration Challenges
Key challenges in VLA integration include:
- Real-time processing constraints
- Sensor fusion and calibration
- Coordinating multiple AI systems
- Ensuring safety and reliability
- Managing computational resources

## Implementation Steps
